# Tasks for lecture 8: collections

- Fork repository `https://github.com/kse-ua/introduction-to-it`
  - We will work with collections: array, set, list, hash
  - Create branch, for example `lab-8`
  - Open directory `introduction-to-it/lecture_notes/08 collection`
- Modify example `1-array.*`
  - Find in search engine how to add and remove array elements
  - Add/remove at the end of array: `push`, `pop`
  - Add/remove at the top of array: `unshift`, `shift`
  - Try to modify and execute examples for JavaScript, Python, and C++
- See example `2-function.*`, here we put code into function for reuse
  - Compare JavaScript and Python examples
  - For those who want C++ try to implement it with C++ (optional)
- Let's use `function expression` (or `lambda`, or `arrow function`)
  - Compare `3-func-exp.js` and `3-lambda.py`
- Array concatenation for JavaScript, Python, and C++
  - We have 3 versions, let's analyze `4-concat.*`
  - Refactor example moving concatenation to the function for C++
  - Optimize JavaScript example
  - Python need no improvements, it's simple enough
- Data structures: set, dictionary
  - Translate JavaScript examples with Set and Map to Python
  - Use `set` and `dict` for Python
  - For those who want C++ try to implement it with C++ (optional)
